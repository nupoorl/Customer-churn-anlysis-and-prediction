Customer-churn-anlysis-and-prediction


This project focuses on analyzing an e-commerce customer dataset to uncover key insights into churn drivers, behavioral patterns, and emerging trends. The Power BI dashboard enables the identification of potential data anomalies and manipulation patterns through interactive visualizations. Following the exploratory analysis, the labeled data is used to build and train predictive machine learning models. Both supervised algorithms—such as Random Forest and Logistic Regression—and unsupervised algorithms—such as KNN and SVM—are applied. Model performance is then evaluated based on accuracy metrics to determine the most effective predictive model.
